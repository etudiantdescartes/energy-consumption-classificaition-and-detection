Small kaggle challenge done as a project assignment.
- ```step_a.py``` reads a csv containing time series, trains a XGBoost model for time series classification and evaluates it.
- ```step_b.py``` reads multiple csvs containing time series for different home appliances, trains an LSTM model for energy consumption detection in time series and evaluates it.
